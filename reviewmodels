Log models with MLflow

### Explanation in Plain English

When you train a machine learning model, you can use any open-source framework that fits your project (like Scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow). After training, you’ll want to **deploy** the model so it can be used to make predictions.

**MLflow** is an open-source tool that simplifies the process of deploying machine learning models. It works with any type of model, no matter which framework you used to train it.

Azure Machine Learning integrates with MLflow, making it even easier to deploy your models. For example:
- If you have a model tracked with MLflow, Azure Machine Learning allows you to deploy it without writing any code (a **no-code deployment**). This saves time and effort, especially for users who want a quick and straightforward deployment process. 

In short, MLflow and Azure Machine Learning together make it simple to train, track, and deploy machine learning models efficiently.



### Why Use MLflow? (Plain English)

When you train a machine learning model in Azure Machine Learning, **MLflow** helps you manage and share your model easily. It standardizes how models are packaged, making it simple to move models between different environments or workflows.

#### Example:
- Imagine you train a model in a **development workspace**. Later, you want to move it to a **production workspace**. With MLflow, you can export the model from one workspace and import it into another without any hassle.

#### How It Works:
- When you train and log a model, MLflow stores all the important files (artifacts) in a directory.
- It also creates an **MLmodel file** in that directory. This file contains metadata about the model, like its version and how it was trained. This metadata ensures you can trace the model's history.

#### How to Register Models:
1. **Autologging**: Automatically logs your model and its details during training.
2. **Custom Logging**: Manually log specific details about your model.

In short, MLflow makes it easy to track, share, and move your machine learning models while keeping all the important details intact.


### Using Autologging to Log a Model (Plain English)

When you train a machine learning model, **MLflow autologging** makes it easy to automatically track everything about your training process. This includes:
- **Parameters**: The settings you used to train the model.
- **Metrics**: The performance results of the model (e.g., accuracy, loss).
- **Artifacts**: Any files generated during training (e.g., plots, logs).
- **The Model**: The trained model itself.

#### How It Works:
- Add `mlflow.autolog()` to your training script.
- When you call the `.fit()` method to train your model, MLflow automatically logs all the details.
- MLflow also detects the framework you’re using (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and logs it as the **flavor** of your model.

#### Specify a Flavor:
If you want to explicitly define the framework (flavor) of your model, you can use a specific autologging function. For example:
- **Keras**: `mlflow.keras.autolog()`
- **Scikit-learn**: `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()`
- **LightGBM**: `mlflow.lightgbm.autolog()`
- **XGBoost**: `mlflow.xgboost.autolog()`
- **TensorFlow**: `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()`
- **PyTorch**: `mlflow.pytorch.autolog()`
- **ONNX**: `mlflow.onnx.autolog()`

#### Example:
If you’re training a Scikit-learn model, you can use:
```python
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()
```
This ensures MLflow logs everything specific to Scikit-learn.

### Why Use Autologging?
- **Saves Time**: No need to manually log details about your training process.
- **Consistency**: Ensures all important information is captured.
- **Flexibility**: Works with many popular machine learning frameworks.

In short, autologging simplifies tracking your machine learning experiments, making it easier to manage and reproduce your work.


### Manually Logging a Model (Plain English)

Sometimes, you may want more control over how your model is logged. In such cases, you can use **MLflow autologging** for parameters, metrics, and artifacts, but **disable automatic model logging** by setting `log_models=False`. This allows you to manually log the model and customize its behavior.

---

### Why Manually Log a Model?
- **Customization**: You can define exactly how the model should behave during inference (when making predictions).
- **Control**: You can specify the expected inputs and outputs of the model, ensuring it works as intended when deployed.

---

### Model Signature
- The **model signature** defines the structure (schema) of the model's inputs and outputs.
- It is stored in the **MLmodel file** (a metadata file) in JSON format.
- The signature ensures that the model knows what kind of data to expect as input and what kind of predictions it will produce as output.

---

### How to Customize the Signature
1. **Infer the Signature Automatically**:
   - Use the `infer_signature()` function to automatically determine the schema of the inputs and outputs.
   - For example:
     - Use your **training dataset** to infer the input schema.
     - Use the model's **predictions** to infer the output schema.

2. **Manually Define the Signature**:
   - If needed, you can define the signature by hand to specify custom input and output formats.

---

### Example: Inferring the Signature
Here’s how you can infer the signature from your training data and model predictions:
```python
from mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature

# Infer the signature from the training data and model predictions
signature = infer_signature(input_data=train_data, predictions=model.predict(train_data))

# Log the model with the inferred signature
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(
    sk_model=model,
    artifact_path="model",
    signature=signature
)
```

---

### Why Use a Signature?
- Ensures the model behaves correctly during deployment.
- Makes it easier to validate the inputs and outputs when the model is used for predictions.

In short, manually logging a model gives you full control over how it is tracked and deployed, while the **signature** ensures the model works as expected during inference.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature

iris = datasets.load_iris()
iris_train = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=7, random_state=0)
clf.fit(iris_train, iris.target)

# Infer the signature from the training dataset and model's predictions
signature = infer_signature(iris_train, clf.predict(iris_train))

# Log the scikit-learn model with the custom signature
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(clf, "iris_rf", signature=signature)

ABOVE CODE EXPLANATION 
### Explanation of the Code in Plain English

This code demonstrates how to train a machine learning model, infer its input and output schema (signature), and log it using **MLflow** for tracking and deployment.

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - The necessary libraries are imported:
     - `pandas` for handling data.
     - `sklearn` for loading the Iris dataset and training a Random Forest model.
     - `mlflow` and `mlflow.sklearn` for logging the model.
     - `infer_signature` from `mlflow.models.signature` to infer the model's input and output schema.

2. **Load the Iris Dataset**:
   - The Iris dataset is loaded using `datasets.load_iris()`.
   - The features (input data) are converted into a Pandas DataFrame (`iris_train`) for easier handling.

3. **Train a Random Forest Model**:
   - A **Random Forest Classifier** is created with a maximum depth of 7 and a fixed random seed for reproducibility.
   - The model is trained using the `.fit()` method with the input data (`iris_train`) and the target labels (`iris.target`).

4. **Infer the Model Signature**:
   - The **signature** (schema of inputs and outputs) is inferred using `infer_signature()`:
     - **Inputs**: The training dataset (`iris_train`).
     - **Outputs**: The model's predictions (`clf.predict(iris_train)`).
   - The signature ensures that the model knows what kind of data to expect as input and what kind of predictions it will produce.

5. **Log the Model with MLflow**:
   - The trained model is logged using `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`:
     - **`clf`**: The trained Random Forest model.
     - **`"iris_rf"`**: The name of the model artifact.
     - **`signature=signature`**: The inferred signature is included to define the model's input and output schema.

---

### Why Use This Approach?
- **Model Tracking**: MLflow logs the model, making it easy to track and manage.
- **Signature Validation**: The signature ensures the model behaves correctly during deployment by validating inputs and outputs.
- **Reusability**: The logged model can be reused or deployed in different environments.

In short, this code trains a model, defines its expected behavior (inputs and outputs), and logs it with MLflow for easy tracking and deployment.



from mlflow.models.signature import ModelSignature
from mlflow.types.schema import Schema, ColSpec

# Define the schema for the input data
input_schema = Schema([
  ColSpec("double", "sepal length (cm)"),
  ColSpec("double", "sepal width (cm)"),
  ColSpec("double", "petal length (cm)"),
  ColSpec("double", "petal width (cm)"),
])

# Define the schema for the output data
output_schema = Schema([ColSpec("long")])

# Create the signature object
signature = ModelSignature(inputs=input_schema, outputs=output_schema)


ABOVE CODE EXPLANATION 

### Explanation of the Code in Plain English

This code demonstrates how to manually define a **model signature** for a machine learning model. The **model signature** specifies the structure (schema) of the input data and the output predictions, ensuring that the model behaves correctly during deployment.

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Import Required Classes**:
   - `ModelSignature`: Used to define the overall signature of the model (inputs and outputs).
   - `Schema`: Represents the structure of the data (a collection of columns).
   - `ColSpec`: Defines the type and name of each column in the schema.

2. **Define the Input Schema**:
   - The input schema specifies the structure of the data the model expects as input.
   - Each column in the input data is defined using `ColSpec`, which includes:
     - **Type**: The data type of the column (e.g., `"double"` for floating-point numbers).
     - **Name**: The name of the column (e.g., `"sepal length (cm)"`).

   Example:
   ```python
   input_schema = Schema([
       ColSpec("double", "sepal length (cm)"),
       ColSpec("double", "sepal width (cm)"),
       ColSpec("double", "petal length (cm)"),
       ColSpec("double", "petal width (cm)"),
   ])
   ```
   This schema defines four input features, all of type `double` (floating-point numbers).

3. **Define the Output Schema**:
   - The output schema specifies the structure of the model's predictions.
   - In this case, the output is a single column of type `"long"` (integer), representing the predicted class label.

   Example:
   ```python
   output_schema = Schema([ColSpec("long")])
   ```

4. **Create the Model Signature**:
   - The `ModelSignature` object combines the input and output schemas into a single signature.
   - This signature is used to validate the inputs and outputs when the model is deployed.

   Example:
   ```python
   signature = ModelSignature(inputs=input_schema, outputs=output_schema)
   ```

---

### Why Use This Approach?
- **Validation**: Ensures the model receives the correct input format and produces the expected output format during deployment.
- **Clarity**: Clearly defines the structure of the data, making it easier to understand and debug.
- **Reusability**: The signature can be reused across different environments to ensure consistency.

In short, this code defines a clear structure for the data the model will work with, ensuring it behaves correctly when deployed.




ML FLOW MODEL FORMAT
### Explanation of the MLModel File Format (Plain English)

The **MLModel file** is a key component of the MLflow model format. It acts as a **blueprint** for how the model should be loaded, used, and deployed. This file is automatically created when you log a model with MLflow and contains important metadata about the model.

---

### What Does the MLModel File Include?

   - Specifies the location where the model is stored during the training job.
   - Example: `"artifact_path": "models/iris_rf"`

2. **flavor**:
   - Indicates the machine learning library or framework used to create the model.
   - Example: `"flavors": {"sklearn": {"model_class": "sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier"}}`

3. **model_uuid**:
   - A unique identifier for the registered model.
   - Helps differentiate between multiple models in the same workspace.

4. **run_id**:
   - A unique identifier for the training job or experiment run during which the model was created.
   - Example: `"run_id": "12345abcde"`

5. **signature**:
   - Defines the **schema** of the model's inputs and outputs.
   - Includes:
     - **inputs**: Specifies the valid input format for the model (e.g., features from the training dataset).
     - **outputs**: Specifies the valid output format for the model (e.g., predictions).

CHOOSE FLAVOR 
### Explanation of Flavors in MLflow (Plain English)

In MLflow, a **flavor** refers to the machine learning library or framework used to create a model. Each flavor defines how the model should be saved (persisted) and loaded for use. This flexibility allows MLflow to support a wide range of machine learning frameworks while maintaining compatibility with the MLModel standard.

---

### Why Use Flavors?
1. **Framework-Specific Handling**:
   - Each flavor uses the best practices of its framework to save and load models.
   - For example, a model created with **FastAI** will use FastAI-specific methods for saving and loading.

2. **Interoperability**:
   - Flavors ensure that models created with different frameworks can still be used in a consistent way.
   - For example, a model created with FastAI can still be deployed using MLflow's standard tools.

---

### Example: FastAI Flavor
- If you create an image classification model using **FastAI** (e.g., to detect breast cancer), the FastAI flavor will:
  - Save the model in a way that is optimized for FastAI.
  - Provide instructions on how to load the model back into a FastAI environment.

---

### Python Function Flavor
- The **Python function flavor** is the **default model interface** for models created in MLflow.
- It allows any MLflow Python model to be loaded and used as a `python_function` model, regardless of the framework used to create it.
- This is powerful because it ensures that workflows like deployment work seamlessly across different frameworks.

#### Why Use the Python Function Flavor?
- **Interoperability**: It works with any Python model, no matter which framework was used to train it.
- **Ease of Deployment**: You can deploy models to various environments without worrying about framework-specific details.

---

### Example of a Python Function Flavor
Here’s what a Python function flavor might look like in the MLModel file:
```yaml
flavors:
  python_function:
    data: model.fastai
    env: conda.yaml
    loader_module: mlflow.fastai
    python_version: 3.8.12
```

#### Explanation:
- **`data`**: Points to the file where the model is saved.
- **`env`**: Specifies the Conda environment file that lists the dependencies required to run the model.
- **`loader_module`**: Indicates the module used to load the model (e.g., `mlflow.fastai` for FastAI models).
- **`python_version`**: Specifies the Python version required to run the model.

---

### Why Is This Important?
- **Flexibility**: Each flavor uses the best methods for its framework, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Compatibility**: The Python function flavor ensures that all models can be used in a consistent way, regardless of their framework.
- **Ease of Use**: Reduces the time and effort needed to deploy models in different environments.

In short, flavors in MLflow make it easy to save, load, and deploy models while maintaining compatibility and flexibility across different frameworks.

---

### Summary:
This MLModel file acts as a **blueprint** for the model, providing all the necessary details to load, validate, and deploy it in a consistent and reliable way. It ensures compatibility across environments and frameworks while maintaining traceability and validation.


CONFIGURE SIGNATURE 
### Explanation of Configuring the Signature in MLModel (Plain English)

The **signature** in the MLModel file acts as a **data contract** between your machine learning model and the system that runs it. It defines the structure of the data the model expects as input and the format of the predictions it produces as output. This ensures that the model behaves correctly during deployment.

---

### Types of Signatures:
1. **Column-Based Signature**:
   - Used for **tabular data** (e.g., data in a Pandas DataFrame).
   - Each column in the input or output is defined with a name and data type.
   - Example: A model that predicts a target value based on features like age, sex, and cholesterol levels.

2. **Tensor-Based Signature**:
   - Used for **n-dimensional arrays or tensors** (e.g., images, text, or other unstructured data).
   - Inputs and outputs are defined as tensors with specific shapes and data types.
   - Example: A model that processes images with dimensions `[batch_size, height, width, channels]`.

---

### How the Signature Is Created:
- When you **register a model** with MLflow, the signature is automatically created and stored in the MLModel file.
- If you enable **autologging**, MLflow tries to infer the signature automatically based on the training data and model predictions.

---

### Why the Signature Is Important:
1. **Validation**:
   - The signature ensures that the data sent to the model during deployment matches the expected format.
   - For example, if the model expects a column named "age" of type `long`, the input data must include this column with the correct type.

2. **Enforcement**:
   - When deploying a model using **Azure Machine Learning's no-code deployment**, the inputs and outputs defined in the signature are strictly enforced.
   - If the input data doesn't match the schema, the deployment will reject it.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - If the automatically inferred signature doesn't meet your requirements, you can manually define and log a custom signature.

---

### Example:
- **Column-Based Signature**:
  ```yaml
  inputs: '[{"name": "age", "type": "long"}, {"name": "sex", "type": "long"}]'
  outputs: '[{"name": "target", "type": "long"}]'
  ```
  - Input: Two columns (`age` and `sex`), both integers.
  - Output: One column (`target`), an integer.

- **Tensor-Based Signature**:
  ```yaml
  inputs: '[{"type": "tensor", "tensor-spec": {"dtype": "uint8", "shape": [-1, 300, 300, 3]}}]'
  outputs: '[{"type": "tensor", "tensor-spec": {"dtype": "float32", "shape": [-1, 2]}}]'
  ```
  - Input: A batch of images with dimensions `[batch_size, 300, 300, 3]`.
  - Output: A batch of predictions with dimensions `[batch_size, 2]`.

---

### Summary:
- The **signature** defines the expected inputs and outputs for your model.
- It ensures that the model behaves correctly during deployment by validating the data format.
- You can rely on MLflow's autologging to infer the signature or manually define it for more control.
- When deploying models with Azure Machine Learning, the signature is strictly enforced, ensuring compatibility between the model and the data it processes.

When you train a machine learning model in Azure Machine Learning, the model's artifacts (like the trained model file) are stored in the **job's outputs**. To make it easier to manage and track your models, you can **register the model** in the **Azure Machine Learning model registry**.

---

### What Is the Model Registry?
The **model registry** is a centralized place in Azure Machine Learning where you can:
1. **Store Models**: Save your trained models for future use.
2. **Version Models**: Keep track of different versions of the same model.
3. **Organize Models**: Add metadata tags to make it easier to search for specific models.

---

### How Does Model Registration Work?
1. **Name and Version**:
   - Each registered model is identified by a **name** and a **version**.
   - If you register a model with the same name as an existing one, the registry automatically increments the version number.

2. **Metadata Tags**:
   - You can add **tags** to your model to store additional information (e.g., the dataset used, the training framework, or the experiment name).
   - Tags make it easier to search and filter models in the registry.

---

### Why Register a Model?
- **Organization**: Keeps all your models in one place, making it easier to manage them.
- **Versioning**: Tracks changes to your models over time, so you can always go back to a previous version if needed.
- **Deployment**: Registered models can be easily deployed to endpoints for inference.

---

### Summary:
Registering a model in Azure Machine Learning helps you store, version, and organize your trained models. It simplifies model management and ensures that your models are ready for deployment or further experimentation.
